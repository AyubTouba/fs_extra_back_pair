# Contribute to fs_extra
## About me
Hello everyone, my name is Denis. I'm a maintainer at the current time of this project. I begin to write when I study rust. Because the current code base has some inconvenience. When I work full time on rust in other projects I found it. But don't have free time to fix it. Many people make a request to get full access to fs_extra and I'm ready to do it. But I should make sure that the project moves into good hands. Because I planing find 3 hours per week for this project. I'm not sure I have time for programming. But this time I plan to spend on a merge PR, publish a new version, and answer issues. Maybe sometime I found time for codding. But my life very changed much after 24 February when war is begin... When my stupid government begins it. I lost my business and l–µft my country because I don't support what Russians dot it right now. And this little step, what I can do. I've tried to go to the street and say I am against it, but people who follow Russia they know how it ends. Right now have a more important task in my life to survive.
